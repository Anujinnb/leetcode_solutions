# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

This problem contains 2 solutions. It is important to consider brute-force solution before reaching the conclusion

## Brute Force

### Explanation

Since the array is rotated sorted, we can compare each number in the array with minimum value. If that number is the minimum number, then we find the number.

### Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n). The Brute-force solution is the expensive one because it has to go through the whole array and do comparison to find the minimum value.

Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm requires constant space.
